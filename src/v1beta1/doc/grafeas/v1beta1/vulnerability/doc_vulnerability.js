 * Vulnerability provides metadata about a security vulnerability in a Note.
 *
 * @property {number} cvssScore
 *   The CVSS score for this vulnerability.
 *
 * @property {number} severity
 *   Note provider assigned impact of the vulnerability.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [Severity]{@link grafeas.v1beta1.vulnerability.Severity}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} details
 *   All information about the package to specifically identify this
 *   vulnerability. One entry per (version range and cpe_uri) the package
 *   vulnerability has manifested in.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Detail]{@link grafeas.v1beta1.vulnerability.Detail}
 *
 * @property {Object} cvssV3
 *   The full description of the CVSSv3.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [CVSSv3]{@link grafeas.v1beta1.vulnerability.CVSSv3}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} windowsDetails
 *   Windows details get their own format because the information format and
 *   model don't match a normal detail. Specifically Windows updates are done as
 *   patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really are a missing package, rather
 *   than a package being at an incorrect version.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [WindowsDetail]{@link grafeas.v1beta1.vulnerability.WindowsDetail}
 *
 * @property {Object} sourceUpdateTime
 *   The time this information was last changed at the source. This is an
 *   upstream timestamp from the underlying information source - e.g. Ubuntu
 *   security tracker.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
